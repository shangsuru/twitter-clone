# Architecture

## Functional Requirements

- Post a new tweet, which can include not only text but also images and URLs
- View one's own profile and the profile of other users
- Follow and unfollow users
- Get a personal feed to view every tweet from the authenticated user and the users that they follow
- View all tweets regardless if you follow that user or not
- Search for other users profiles or for tweets containing a specific term

## Non-functional requirements

- High scalability with minimum latency
